# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

个人游戏数据仪表盘 — a personal game library dashboard for tracking game purchases, playtime, costs, and platform distribution. Single-page app with Firebase backend.

## Development

This is a **zero-build vanilla JS project**. There is no bundler, no package.json, and no test suite. To develop:

```bash
# Serve the root directory (any static file server works)
npx serve .              # or: python -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:<port>` in a browser. ES modules are loaded from the Firebase CDN (`gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.6.1/`) directly in the browser — no `npm install` needed.

The Firebase Cloud Function source is at `functions/index.js`. Deploy with `firebase deploy --only functions`. The root `index.js` is a copy kept for reference; the authoritative source is in `functions/`.

## Design system

Page palette: warm Tailwind Stone base (`#f5f0ed` background), Amber accent (`#d97706`). All 14 platform colors are white-tinted pastels derived from brand originals with subtle hue shifts — see `js/config/constants.js` `PLATFORM_COLORS`. Trend lines use `pointRadius: 0` (smooth curves only). Scatter chart uses misty cyan tint gradient with white-bordered points and glow halos for high-rated games. Full rationale in **[design.md](design.md)**.

```

**Data flow**: `firestore.js` first loads cached items from IndexedDB (`js/core/cache.js`) for instant render, then listens to Firestore `items` collection via `onSnapshot` for real-time updates. On each Firestore update, items are written into `state.js` (the single source of truth) and cached to IndexedDB, then an `onDataChange` callback fires. `main.js` sets up this callback to re-render all KPIs and charts. Everything downstream reads from `state.items`.

**Auth model**: Google Sign-In via Firebase Auth. Admin UIDs are hardcoded in `constants.js`. Non-admin users see read-only UI (FAB hidden, form buttons disabled). Admin users can add/edit/delete items, import/export CSV, and trigger Steam sync.

**Steam sync**: Cloud Function `syncSteamData` (callable, admin-only) fetches the user's Steam library via Web API, fuzzy-matches game names (exact → normalized → substring → Levenshtein), and binds `steam_app_id` to existing items. `scheduledSteamSync` runs daily at 4:00 AM CST. Per-item `steam_override` field (default `true`) controls whether Steam playtime overwrites local data. The sync also calls `ISteamUserStats/GetPlayerAchievements/v1` per matched game to auto-detect 100% achievement completion (`fullyCompleted`). Games with no achievements or API errors preserve their existing `fullyCompleted` value. The sync button and status display are in the header. Edit form has a Steam section with App ID input and override checkbox (visible when platform is `steam`).

**AI recommendations**: The "接下来" modal calls DeepSeek API (model `deepseek-v4-pro`) to analyze played/backlog games **and dramas** (剧集), then suggest what to play/watch next. Primary path: Firebase Cloud Function (`getAiRecommendations`). Fallback: direct DeepSeek API call from the browser (user must provide their own API key in settings). The Cloud Function prompt only covers games; the browser-side prompt also includes drama data.

## Key patterns

- **No framework**: All DOM manipulation is vanilla JS. Module state is shared via `js/core/state.js` getters/setters.
- **Chart lifecycle**: Charts are stored in `state.charts` keyed by name. `destroyAllCharts()` is called before re-rendering all charts. A lightweight hash of all items' key fields (`fb_id`, `playTime`, `purchasePrice`, `sellPrice`) skips chart re-renders when data hasn't actually changed. Individual chart renders also destroy their own previous instance before creating a new one (needed when charts re-render independently, e.g., distribution mode toggle).
- **Firestore doc shape**: Each item has `id`, `name`, `type`, `sort`, `status`, `purchaseDate`, `startDate` (开始游玩日期, falls back to `purchaseDate` for playtime calculations via `getStartDate()`), `purchasePrice`, `from`, `playTime`, `passDate`, `sellDate`, `sellPrice`, `rating`, `episodeCount`, `episodeDuration`, `fullyCompleted` (boolean, 100% achievement). Steam items additionally have `steam_app_id` (number), `steam_override` (boolean, default true), `steam_last_sync` (timestamp). Firestore doc IDs are stored as `fb_id` on the client side. Drama items (`type: 'drama'`) use `episodeCount` × `episodeDuration` / 60 to auto-calculate `playTime`.
- **Achievement tracking**: `fullyCompleted` marks games with 100% achievements. Can be set manually via checkbox in the edit form (all game platforms), or auto-synced from Steam API during `syncSteamData`. The dashboard KPI card shows the count with a tooltip listing all fully-completed games. The data table has a sortable "全成就" column with trophy icons, and fully-completed rows have a gold border with pulse animation.
- **Metadata**: `metadata/dashboard` tracks `lastManualUpdate` for the "last updated" display. `metadata/steamSync` tracks `lastSyncTime`, `matchedCount`, `unmatchedCount`, `unmatchedGames`, `achievementsChecked`, `fullyCompletedCount` for Steam sync status.

## Standalone tools

```
tools/
├── bind_steam_ids/
│   └── bind_steam_ids.js        # Node.js: batch-bind Steam App IDs to Firestore items
├── cost_per_hour/
│   ├── cost_per_hour_trend.py   # Python: cost-per-hour trend chart from CSV export
│   └── cost_per_hour_trend.png
└── steam_info/
    ├── steam_info.py            # Python: fetch comprehensive Steam profile and library data
    ├── run.bat                  # Windows launcher (double-click to run)
    └── .env                     # STEAM_API_KEY (gitignored)
```

`cost_per_hour_trend.py` reads `game_cost_export_*.csv` from the project root, filters out hardware/drama/free/zero-playtime games, and generates a cumulative cost-per-hour curve. Uses matplotlib; no dependencies beyond Python 3 + matplotlib. Run with `python tools/cost_per_hour/cost_per_hour_trend.py`.

`bind_steam_ids.js` uses the Firebase REST API with an access token from `~/.config/configstore/firebase-tools.json` to PATCH `steam_app_id` onto existing Firestore items. Supports `--dry-run` for preview. Run with `node tools/bind_steam_ids/bind_steam_ids.js`.

`steam_info.py` calls 7 Steam Web API endpoints (player summary, owned games, recently played, level, badges, friends, bans) and writes one CSV per endpoint under `tools/steam_info/output/`. Reads `STEAM_API_KEY` from env var or `.env` file (gitignored). Defaults to project Steam ID; override with `--steamid`. Run with `python tools/steam_info/steam_info.py` or double-click `run.bat`.
